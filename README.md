This project aims to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. When a user submits a URL of an article, the web page then displays sentiment analysis returned from [meaningcloud API](https://www.meaningcloud.com/products/sentiment-analysis), based on the contents of the article.
